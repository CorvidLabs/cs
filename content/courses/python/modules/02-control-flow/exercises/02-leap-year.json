If divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400\n\n## Examples\n\n- 2024 is a leap year (divisible by 4, not by 100)\n- 2000 is a leap year (divisible by 400)\n- 1900 is NOT a leap year (divisible by 100, but not 400)\n- 2023 is NOT a leap year (not divisible by 4)\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Create a variable called `year` with a year value\n2. Create a variable called `is_leap_year` that is `True` if it's a leap year, `False` otherwise",
