# Your First Python Program

Every programming journey begins with a simple greeting. In Python, printing to the console is as straightforward as it gets.

## The print() Function

Python's `print()` function displays text to the console:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

When you run this code, you'll see:

```
Hello, World!
```

## What's Happening?

- `print` is a **function** - a reusable piece of code that performs an action
- The parentheses `()` contain what we want to print
- `"Hello, World!"` is a **string** - text enclosed in quotes
- Python executes this line and displays the text

## Strings in Python

You can use either single or double quotes for strings:

```python
print('Hello with single quotes!')
print("Hello with double quotes!")
```

Both produce the same result. Choose whichever you prefer, but stay consistent.

## Multiple print() Statements

Each `print()` outputs on a new line:

```python
print("First line")
print("Second line")
print("Third line")
```

Output:
```
First line
Second line
Third line
```

## Comments

Comments help explain your code and are ignored when running:

```python
# This is a comment - Python ignores this line
print("This line runs!")  # Comments can also go at the end
```

## Try It Yourself

Experiment with different messages. Try:
- Printing your name
- Printing multiple lines
- Adding comments to explain your code

## Key Takeaways

1. `print()` displays output to the console
2. Strings are text enclosed in quotes (single or double)
3. Comments start with `#` and are ignored by Python
4. Each `print()` statement creates a new line

You've written your first Python program! In the next lesson, we'll learn how to store and work with data using variables.
