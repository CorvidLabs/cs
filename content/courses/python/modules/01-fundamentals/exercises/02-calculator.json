Calculate and store the sum in a variable called `sum_result`\n3. Calculate and store the difference in a variable called `difference`\n4. Calculate and store the product in a variable called `product`\n5. Calculate and store the quotient in a variable called `quotient`\n\n## Expected Values\n\n- sum_result = 13\n- difference = 7\n- product = 30\n- quotient = 3.333... (approximately)",
