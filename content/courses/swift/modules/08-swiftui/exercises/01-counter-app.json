    "description": "Build a simple counter app to practice @State and button actions.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Create a `CounterView` with:\n   - A `@State` variable `count` starting at 0\n   - A `Text` view displaying the current count with a large title font\n   - An \"Increment\" button that adds 1 to count\n   - A \"Decrement\" button that subtracts 1 from count\n   - A \"Reset\" button that sets count back to 0\n\n2. Layout:\n   - Center everything vertically in a VStack\n   - Use proper spacing between elements\n   - Style the buttons appropriately\n\n3. Bonus: Disable the decrement button when count is 0\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Tapping Increment increases the count\n- Tapping Decrement decreases the count\n- Tapping Reset sets count to 0\n- The display updates immediately on each tap",
