Create a constant `lastName` with value \"Lovelace\"\n3. Create a constant `birthYear` with value 1815 (as an Int)\n4. Create a constant `bio` that combines all information\n5. Print the bio\n\n## Expected Output\n\n```\nAda Lovelace was born in 1815.\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n- Use string interpolation with `\\(value)` to insert values into strings\n- The bio should be a single, complete sentence",
