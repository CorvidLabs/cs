    "description": "Create a protocol hierarchy for different types of vehicles demonstrating protocol inheritance and conformance.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Define a `Vehicle` protocol with:\n   - `speed: Double` property (read-only)\n   - `move()` method\n\n2. Define a `Fuel` protocol with:\n   - `fuelLevel: Double` property (read-write)\n   - `refuel(amount: Double)` method\n\n3. Create a `Car` struct that conforms to both protocols with:\n   - Properties: `make`, `model`, `speed`, `fuelLevel`\n   - `move()` prints \"Driving at [speed] mph\"\n   - `refuel(amount:)` adds to fuelLevel (max 100)\n\n4. Create a `Bicycle` struct that conforms only to `Vehicle` with:\n   - Properties: `brand`, `speed`\n   - `move()` prints \"Cycling at [speed] mph\"\n\n## Expected Output\n\n```\nDriving at 65.0 mph\nCycling at 15.0 mph\nFuel level: 75.0\n```",
