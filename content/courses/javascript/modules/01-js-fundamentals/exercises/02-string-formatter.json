    "description": "Practice working with strings and template literals by creating formatted output.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Create variables for a person's information:\n   - `firstName` = \"Ada\"\n   - `lastName` = \"Lovelace\"\n   - `birthYear` = 1815\n   - `profession` = \"mathematician\"\n\n2. Create a `fullName` variable that combines first and last name with a space\n\n3. Create an `introduction` variable using a template literal that produces:\n   \"Ada Lovelace was a mathematician born in 1815.\"\n\n4. Create an `initials` variable containing just the first letters: \"AL\"\n\n## Expected Output\n\n- fullName: \"Ada Lovelace\"\n- introduction: \"Ada Lovelace was a mathematician born in 1815.\"\n- initials: \"AL\"",
