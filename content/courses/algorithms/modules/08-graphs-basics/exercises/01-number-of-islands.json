  "explanation": "We iterate through the grid. When we find a '1' (land), we start a DFS to explore and mark all connected land cells. Each DFS call marks one complete island. We count how many times we initiate a DFS from unvisited land cells. Time: O(rows * cols), Space: O(rows * cols) for recursion stack in worst case."
