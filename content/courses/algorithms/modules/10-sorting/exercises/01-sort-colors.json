  ],
  "hints": [
    "Use three pointers: low (0s boundary), mid (current), high (2s boundary)",
    "Elements before low are all 0s, elements after high are all 2s",
    "When you see 0, swap with low and advance both pointers",
    "When you see 2, swap with high but only decrement high (need to check swapped value)"
  ],
  "explanation": "The Dutch National Flag algorithm uses three pointers. 'low' marks where the next 0 should go, 'high' marks where the next 2 should go, and 'mid' is the current element. When we see 0, swap it to the low section. When we see 2, swap it to the high section. When we see 1, leave it in place. Key insight: after swapping with high, don't advance mid because the swapped element hasn't been examined yet. Time: O(n), Space: O(1)."
