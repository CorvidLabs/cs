  "explanation": "Classic 2-sequence DP. dp[i][j] = LCS of first i chars of text1 and first j chars of text2. If text1[i-1] == text2[j-1], they match and extend the LCS by 1. Otherwise, take the max of excluding either character. Space optimization: we only need the previous row, so use two 1D arrays. Time: O(m × n), Space: O(n)."
