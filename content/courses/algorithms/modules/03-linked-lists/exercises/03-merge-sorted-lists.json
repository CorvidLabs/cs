  ],
  "explanation": "We use a dummy node to simplify handling the head of the result. We compare the heads of both lists, attach the smaller one to our result, and advance that list's pointer. We continue until one list is exhausted, then attach the remaining nodes from the other list. Time is O(n + m) where n and m are list lengths, and space is O(1) since we reuse existing nodes."
