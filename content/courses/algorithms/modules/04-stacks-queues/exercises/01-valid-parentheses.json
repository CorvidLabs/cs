  "explanation": "We use a stack to track unmatched opening brackets. When we see an opening bracket, push it. When we see a closing bracket, check if the top of the stack is its matching opening bracket. If not, or if the stack is empty, it's invalid. At the end, if the stack is empty, all brackets were matched. Time is O(n) and space is O(n) in the worst case."
