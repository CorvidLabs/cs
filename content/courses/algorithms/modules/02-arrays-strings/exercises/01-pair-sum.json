  ],
  "hints": [
    "Start with two pointers: left at index 0, right at the last index",
    "If the sum is too small, move the left pointer right to increase it",
    "If the sum is too large, move the right pointer left to decrease it",
    "Since the array is sorted, this approach works in O(n) time"
  ],
  "explanation": "The two-pointer technique is efficient for sorted arrays. We start with pointers at both ends. If the current sum equals the target, we found our pair. If it's too small, we move the left pointer right (to a larger value). If it's too large, we move the right pointer left (to a smaller value). This works because the array is sorted, so moving pointers changes the sum predictably. Time complexity is O(n), space is O(1)."
